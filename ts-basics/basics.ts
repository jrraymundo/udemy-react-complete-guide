/**
 * GENERICS
 * This feature allows us to create "type" variables, that allows for more flexible type declarations
 * It can be use in many scenarios but for this example it's used for a function
 * 
 * Think of 'T' as a placeholder variable for the type data
 * that you would pass as soon as you call the function.
 * You could pass an array of strings for 1st arg, and a string for 2nd arg
 * in that case TypeScript would substitute 'T' with string.
 * 
 * Note that the 1st arg's type takes precedence.
 * 
 * This can be a handful to process and there's more to it so check the docs for more info
 * https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html#generics
